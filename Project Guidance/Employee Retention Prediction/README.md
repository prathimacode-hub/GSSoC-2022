## Description : 
- Dataset is collected from kaggle.com

Employee churn is a major problem for many firms these days. Great talent is scarce, hard to keep and in high demand. Given the well-known direct relationship between happy employees and happy customers, it becomes of utmost importance to understand the drivers of employee dissatisfaction.

This project emphasizes on predicting retention of an employee within an organization such that whether the employee will leave the company or continue with it. It uses the data of previous employees who have worked for the company and by finding a pattern it predicts the retention in the form of yes or no.

The parameters we are using, such as salary, number of years spent in the company, promotions, number of hours, work accident, financial background, etc. Through this project, an organization can choose its strategies to keep great representatives from leaving the organization. The data has 14,999 examples (samples). Below are the features and the definitions of each one:

- satisfaction_level: Level of satisfaction {0â€“1}.
- last_evaluationTime: Time since last performance evaluation (in years).
- number_project: Number of projects completed while at work.
- average_montly_hours: Average monthly hours at the workplace.
- time_spend_company: Number of years spent in the company.
- Work_accident: Whether the employee had a workplace accident.
- left: Whether the employee left the workplace or not {0, 1}.
- promotion_last_5years: Whether the employee was promoted in the last five years.
- sales: Department the employee works for.
- salary: Relative level of salary {low, medium, high}.

To check the accuracy of different algorithms, so as to pick the best model. I have tried the following three models on the dataset.

| ALGORITHM      | SCORE 
| :---        |    :----:   
| KNN     |      92.17 %
| SVM |          94.51 %
| DECISION TREE |96.49 %

## ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ **DECISION TREE** PERFORMS WELL ON THIS EMPLOYEE RETENTION DATASET WITH AN ACCURACY OF 96.49 % ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³
